This project aims at demonstrating some of the functionality of olap4j. They are not a tutorial, but serve as a source of sample code snippets.

To use, you will need Apache Ant 1.7 or newer. Then simply run "ant" in a terminal where you installed olap4j-demo. It will resolve all dependencies. You can then run the examples. There is also a sample eclipse project included.
